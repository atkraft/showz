#### Brandon

* [Field notes - ElasticSearch at petabyte scale on AWS](https://grey-boundary.io/field-notes-elasticsearch-at-petabyte-scale-on-aws/)
 - A great post on systems design thinking and how to apply it to scaling ElasticSearch clusters. Most of the patterns and thinking that's outlined is applicable to any distributed system.
