Outline/Questions
-----------------

## Welcome!
* Welcome to Foodfight, this is episode 110 of the Foodfight show!  It is fantastic to be back here recording this podcast where we discuss Chef and it's various projects, ops, and everything in between.

## Intro
  * Nell: As always, I'm Nell Shamrell-Harrington - co host of this podcast.  And joining me today are Adam Leff and Tom McLaughlin!  It's great to have you both here and Adam, why don't we start with you telling us a little bit about yourself?
  * Adam: Some introductory thingy

## Announcements
  * ChefConf!  ChefConf was just held in the beautiful city of Austin, TX just a few weeks ago.  I had a great time - lots of connections with community both through and not through code accompanied with, of course, fantastic BBQ.  How was ChefConf for you two?
  * Adam and Tom responded as desired

  * And we had a few major announcements come out of ChefConf!  
    * The one that is nearest and dearest to my heart because I worked on it is the Habitat builder service!  It was an immense amount of work and quite a bit of crunch to get it there toward the end, but what a glorious feeling to see it work live on the main stage.
  * The other major Habitat annoucement was scaffolding - we now have built in Habitat scaffolding for Node.js apps, Rails apps, and more.  This means you can get a Habitat package for your app up and running even faster, which I think is a great win for both developers and operations professionals.
  * Awesome Community Chef Awards!
    * Annie Hedgpeth - in particular with her role around Inspec, she's written some fantastic blog post tutorials on how to use it.  Additionally, Annie is fantastic role model thanks to her honesty, humility, and infectious enthusiasm for learning. We are so thrilled she is part of our community. 
    * Ben Dang - in particular for his work with Habitat.  Ben has been an absolutely incredible representative for the Habitat community; his care and feeding of new community members, the level of effort he has put towards making people feel welcome and heard, and his overall willingness to jump in and help at the drop of a (habi)hat are the reasons we’re ecstatic about having Ben as an integral part of the community.
    * Sean O'Meara - who is a prolific community cookbook maintainer and introduced tools like kitchen-dokken to improve the testing process.  He’s one of the most insightful and passionate members of our community, and his talks have lead many of us into the light.
    * And then the last one, which was actually a major surprise to me.  Adam, to avoid appearing self-serving - do you mind reading that one?
    * Nell Shamrell-Harrington - who is a core maintainer of Supermarket and Habitat peaks at conferences, hosts webinars, writes blog posts, and has conversations with community members on the Food Fight Show podcast. Whether considering your first open source contribution or adopting the latest features of Habitat, Nell is there to help!
  * All in all, it was a fantastic ChefConf and we are super looking forward to next year's!
