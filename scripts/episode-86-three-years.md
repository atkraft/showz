Outline/Questions
-----------------
**avoid navel-gazing**

* favorite episodes
  * bryan
    - adrianco
    - gregkh
* what has gotten better in devops world in last 3 years
  * less friction b/w puppet & chef communities
* airing of grievances - what still sucks and could be a lot better?
  * still no "systems programming" podcast
  * realtalk.io shortlived, also note sad passing of james golick
  * lusis hasn't solved all our problems
  * Chef hasn't been as aggressive in automating non-vm infrastructure, at least not as much as tools like ansible, i.e. managing vpcs, dns
* big surprises:
  * rise of hashicorp stack (Bryan)
  * ruby vm is actually improving steadily (Bryan)
  * the management trend of "No Managers" seems to have crashed and burned (or at least I hope it has) (Bryan)
* open questions:
  * will docker actually be a big deal?
