Outline/Questions

* What are the various tools in the ecosystem?
* I want to get started, what do I do first?
* What workloads are good for k8s?  which are bad?
* Can I forklift an existing app (Oracle, Seibel, SAP) from my datacenter and run it in k8s?  if so, how much work would that be and what's the payoff?
* What is the developer story for k8s? i.e. how can individual devs spin up all related tooling and test their app, ideally locally?
