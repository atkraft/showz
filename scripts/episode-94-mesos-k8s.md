Outline / Questions
-------------------

* What is Mesos?
* What is kubernetes (k8s)?
* Can I forklift a boring existing app (Oracle, Seibel, SAP) from my datacenter and run it in mesos/k8s after a certain amount of integration work?
* I am creating PaaSes for customers on top of AWS w/ high security and HA requirements. Will I just end up reinventing mesos/k8s?
* One risk of going w/ k8s or mesos is that aws will offer its most important features as a service. Will that be a good thing or a bad thing?
* A big player in this space is Hashicorp but they don't have their own scheduler or larger DCOS framework. Do you expect they will create their own or join up w/ mesos/k8s? C'mon speculate wildly, that's what podcasts are all about!
* Will they eventually become competing products as they both mature?
* Are either of them production ready yet? Important note: ur homespun Paas probably isn't prod ready
* How would a mesos or k8s support multiple availability zones?
* Kelsey in ur [talk at ETE](https://vimeo.com/129028022) you talk about L2/L3 bridging. What on earth is that? routing ARP over IP?
* What on earth is Flannel?
* What is the developer story for mesos/k8s? i.e. how can individual devs spin up all related tooling and test their app, ideally locally?
* We talked about Hashicorp's Vault last week. Do k8s or mesos have any tooling around secrets management?
